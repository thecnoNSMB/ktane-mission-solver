resort queue before doing a solve, not after

have: "ask about right keys" flag, forbidden modules by name, required modules by name

resort: move all required solves to the front, move all forbidden solves to the back

interface: when it actually comes up, on the first module, "Turn each module's right key
in descending order of the priority displayed.", then "Turn the lowest priority left
key that hasn't already been turned." for every subsequent solve
